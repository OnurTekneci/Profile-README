**About Me**

🔬 Currently completed my MSc thesis at Hacettepe University, focusing on a Random Forest model for multi-class lithology prediction.

🌱 I’m passionate about environmental and geoscientific data analysis, model interpretability, and interactive visualizations. I'm also increasingly interested in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. Beyond Earth sciences, I enjoy applying my skills to entertainment data — such as analyzing movie trends and music patterns.

💡 In my free time I handle with entertainment data and train myself for other possible tools may be beneficial for my future projects.

**📂 Featured Projects**
**Master’s Thesis: Lithology Classification**

A complete pipeline—including SMOTE oversampling, Random Forest hyperparameter tuning via GridSearchCV, multi-class ROC & PR curves, and Partial Dependence analysis—trained on Australian drillhole assays.

**Title**: Integration of Random Forest for Lithological Prediction from Sample Assay Value
**Institution**: Hacettepe University – MSc in Mining Engineering
**Advisor**: Assoc. Prof. Fırat Atalay
**Year**: 2025

This project explores the potential of using geochemical assay data from exploration drilling to predict lithological units using machine learning. A dataset of 21 drillholes from the Nuckulla region in South Australia was used to develop a full classification pipeline. The project involved:

-Preprocessing and standardizing assay data

-Handling class imbalance with SMOTE oversampling

-Model training and optimization using Random Forest + GridSearchCV

-Evaluation with multiclass ROC/PR curves, partial dependence plots, and class probability confidence

-Exploratory visualization and feature importance analysis

The study demonstrated the challenges of imbalanced data in geoscience, highlighted the predictive strength of low-grade intervals, and identified the limitations of using Random Forest for practical lithology prediction in sparse datasets.

📁 All steps are implemented in Jupyter notebooks
📊 Visual outputs include confidence histograms, boxplots, ROC/PR curves


**🚀 Getting Started**
**IMDB250 Insights in time**

This project analyzes the IMDb Top 250 movie list to uncover long-term trends in film quality, genre preferences, and cinematic evolution. Using data science tools, it explores:

The dominance of different eras in the Top 250

How recent films compare to older classics

Shifts in genre popularity and country contributions

The staying power of new entries on the list

The goal is to challenge the common belief that "they don’t make movies like they used to" — with real data.
